# TL;DR
* "/server" directory contains all the backend functionality (database stuff and google auth implementation).
* "/src" directory contains all the pages for the website - basically the frontend.
* Bolt made the project structure kinda weird so some of the files in the front end are outside of the src directory.
* Make sure to run "npm install" at both the root level and within the root directory to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json files.
* Now running "npm run dev" at the root level should run both front and back end simultaneously - You should see something like this in your terminal :

  ## Example Terminal output:
          npm run dev                                                       
          
          > vite-react-typescript-starter@0.0.0 dev
          > concurrently "npm run dev:server" "npm run dev:client"
